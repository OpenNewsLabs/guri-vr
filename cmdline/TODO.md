# Issues
- make it work in AR

# Have a good support of aframe-ar.js
- support ar.js options from the guri-xr

# Idea with twitter and AR.js Augmented Website
- make it work with library like 3d.io
- with the twitter cards
- tweet 'i want a 3d.io furniture XXX in ar' and it replies the link with the twitter cards
- and you consume it directly on twitter
- it can be an iframe too that you put in any site
